About

We believe every human on the planet should have the option of free access to the world’s information and content. In many cases this belief is powered by a three way value exchange between a publisher producing free content, a consumer consuming it and an advertiser paying the publisher for the chance to connect with its audience. The underpinning of this value exchange relies on having an independent auditing, measurement and optimization layer to power the transaction between the advertiser and publisher.

Today the industry standard tools for advertising and media measurement and optimization are usually designed where increased personalization, higher advertising return on investment and increased publisher revenues often comes with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase while enabling the necessary business use-cases to effectively keep the world’s information and content free for everyone.

VideoAmp’s mission is to create software and data solutions to enable advertisers to accurately measure and optimize their entire portfolio of linear TV, OTT, digital and walled garden investments while empowering publishers to effectively align and monetize their audiences with the advertiser’s desired outcome in a consumer-first privacy paradigm.

Minimum base salary of $ 125,000 + Equity + Benefits. The actual compensation offer will be determined by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, applicant's qualifications, skills, and experience.

"Deployment Strategist, Internship","A World-Changing Company

At Palantir, we’re driven to solve the world's most critical and challenging problems, and believe that building software to enable human decision making is the most effective vector. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more.

The Role

As a Deployment Strategist Intern, you'll work as part of a diverse, generative, and creative team of Engineers, Product Designers, and other Deployment Strategists to deploy software against the most challenging problems our world faces. Your mission is to synthesize disconnected streams of thought into a cohesive understanding of what the problem is, what the data means, what the product needs, what users are motivated by, and where the impact could be. The problems you'll tackle will require a curious and analytical mindset, a sharp intuition for product, an ability to speak the language of data, and an understanding that humans should make decisions.

At its core, this role is about uncovering dots and—without knowing the shape they form—figuring out how to connect them. Our customers come to us with a hunch that the only way to protect their troops, manufacture high-quality products, structure effective healthcare policies, or deliver aid to refugees safely is to make better use of their data. Deployment Strategists are responsible for turning that hunch into reality.

Deployment Strategists are do-ers who thrive in ambiguity, react quickly to new stimuli, and don't equate pivoting with failing as they operate in pursuit of truth, value, and meaningful impact. In this internship, you'll immerse yourself in intricate customer workflows, explore data using quantitative analytics across large datasets, and dive into the product landscape.

If you believe in the transformational power of data and technology and in your own ability to bring that power to bear against complex problems, we want to meet you.

No two days are the same, but as a Deployment Strategist you can expect to:

Go onsite and meet with customer analysts to understand the critical questions they need to answer and locate their biggest struggles, and build and deliver demos.Build a case for gaining access to the relevant datasets, and work with Forward Deployed Engineers to integrate the data into a stable and extensible pipeline.Create and lead training sessions to ensure that the product is meeting the needs of a range of users, and is being used widely enough to have concrete impact on our partners' operations.Present the results of our work and proposals for future work to audiences ranging from analysts to C-suite executives.Embed with our Software Engineering and Product Design teams to incorporate what you saw in the field into cross-Palantir product offerings.

What We Value

Extraordinary ability to take on open-ended problems in unstructured environments.Ability to be adaptive and introspective; willingness to learn, teach, lead and follow.Ability to travel as needed. Varies by location and team.Experience with programming, scripting or statistical packages (e.g. Python, R, Matlab, SQL) is a plus.

What We Require

Must be planning on graduating in 2025. This should be your final internship before graduating.

Salary

The estimated salary range for this position is estimated to be $6,300/month. Further note that total compensation for this position will be determined by each individual’s relevant qualifications, work experience, skills, and other factors. This estimate excludes the value of any benefits offered; and the potential future value of any long-term incentives.

Life at Palantir

We want every Palantirian to achieve their best outcomes, that’s why we celebrate individuals’ strengths, skills, and interests, from your first interview to your longterm growth, rather than rely on traditional career ladders.
